# Sparkdog-PF-DI-V2
KiCad project for hardware development of Sparkdog PF-DI PCB. The Sparkdog PF-DI PCB can be used as a plug in PCB for the Rabbit ECU, extending the functionality to include:

1. Either Teensy 3.5 MK64 or MK10 processor, or both
2. 4 x Direct injection driver circuit
3. 2 x knock input circuit
4. 1 x 4-channel H-Bridge driver
5. 4 VVT input channels in addition to the Rabbit ECU Crank/Cam inputs
6. PIC18F26 stay-alive processor for can wake-up function
